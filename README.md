# 📚 Booking System

A complete **Hospital Booking System** built with **React Native** (Frontend) and **NestJS Microservices** (Backend).  
It features a clean UI, efficient APIs, scalable architecture, and reliable state management.

---

## 🚀 Technologies Used

**Frontend:**

- React Native – Core mobile app framework
- React Native Paper – UI component library
- Redux – Global state management
- Redux Toolkit – Simplified Redux setup
- Redux Persist – Persist and rehydrate Redux state
- Redux Logger – Middleware for logging Redux actions
- Yup – Schema validation for forms
- react-native-size-matters – Responsive sizing across device

**Backend:**

- NestJS – Progressive Node.js framework for scalable backend services
- GraphQL – Flexible and efficient API query language
- PostgreSQL – Robust, open-source relational database
- Docker – Containerized backend services for consistent deployment
- Microservices Architecture – Independent service modules for high scalability and maintainability

## 🎯 Features

**Frontend:**

- Authentication: Seamless login and registration flows
- Hospital Booking: Schedule appointments with doctors
- Form Validation: Strong validation using Yup
- State Management: Efficient handling with Redux Toolkit
- Persisted State: Retain user sessions with Redux Persist
- UI/UX: Modern design using React Native Paper
- Developer Tools: Debug with Redux Logger
- Responsive Design: Perfect scaling across devices

**Backend:**

- GraphQL API: Flexible and efficient data queries/mutations
- Modular Services: Scalable microservices (e.g., auth, booking, notifications)
- PostgreSQL Database: Secure, reliable storage
- Dockerized Setup: Consistent development and deployment environments
- Microservices: Independent, maintainable services for high scalability

---

## 📋 Why Microservices?

- **Scalability**: Scale parts of the system independently (e.g., bookings, users)
- **Maintainability**: Easier to update and debug isolated services
- **Deployment Flexibility**: Deploy services independently based on traffic needs
- **Resilience**: Isolated failures without impacting the full system
- **Team Collaboration**: Parallel development by different teams
